= Project: Remote-Solar-Irrigation-Pump


== Description:

Thin is the location of the code development for the Offgrid Solar Irrigation Capstone Project originally by WSU-V students, Emily, Nate, and Gunnar sponsored by TSMC Washington (formerly WaferTech). The project is at rest until further interest is found within the community. 

== Motivation:

In efforts to drive environmental awareness and promote green energy, TSMC WA wished to help the community by planting native species plants, trees, and shrubs on two, one-acre fields located a short distance away from their Camas HQ. 

== GOAL:
The goal of this project was to design an off-grid, portable, maintenance-free irrigation System. The system must to operate independently for Camas's three dryest summer months, June, July, and August. The system must increase plant survivability by at least 10% form an estimated 50% survivability of existing plants after one year. 

== Methodology:

Part I: Feasability Study and Proposal
  a. Study the effect of the proposed water dispurtion in relation to average montly rainfall in Camas.
  b. Measure plant surviviability of existing one-year-old crop.
  c. Present 3-4 viable irrigaion system solutions.
  d. Measure ground pressures for suitable location for 3,000 gallon cistern.

Part II: Design Build
  a. Submit design drawings and Bill of Materials.
  b. Purchase Request of Materials.
  c. Build Prototype and Test.

== Project Resources:
1. Google Drive - contains all original design and construction documents generated by the team since project start in October, 2023 (~6 months worth).
