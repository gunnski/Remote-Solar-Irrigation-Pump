## Description:

This is the location of the code development for the Off-grid Solar Irrigation Capstone Project originally by WSU-V students, Emily, Nate, and Gunnar sponsored by TSMC Washington (formerly WaferTech). The project is at rest until further interest is found within the community. 

## Motivation:

In efforts to drive environmental awareness and promote green energy, TSMC WA wished to help the community by planting native species plants, trees, and shrubs on two, one-acre fields located a short distance away from their Camas HQ. 

## GOAL:
The goal of this project was to design an off-grid, portable, maintenance-free irrigation System. The system must to operate independently for Camas's three driest summer months, June, July, and August. The system must increase plant survivability by at least 10% form an estimated 50% survivability of existing plants after one year. 

## Methodology:

### Part I: Feasibility Study and Proposal
* Study the effect of the proposed water disruption in relation to average monthly rainfall in Camas.
* Measure plant survivability of existing one-year-old crop.
* Present 3-4 viable irrigation system solutions.
* Measure ground pressures for suitable location for 3,000 gallon cistern.

### Part II: Design Build
* Submit design drawings and Bill of Materials.
* Purchase Request of Materials.
 * Build Prototype and Test.
